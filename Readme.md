# Overview
I am excited to share the Age Calculator project. This web-based tool allows users to calculate their age in years, months, and days based on their date of birth. The project showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Features
- User Input: Users can input their date of birth through a simple and intuitive interface.
- Dynamic Calculation: The calculator dynamically computes the age in years, months, and days upon user input.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring it works seamlessly across various devices and screen sizes.
- Interactive UI: A user-friendly interface with clear labels and buttons enhances the user experience.

# Technologies Used
- HTML: For structuring the web page and creating form elements.
- CSS: For styling the calculator and making it visually appealing.
- JavaScript: For implementing the logic to calculate the age and updating the results dynamically.

# How It Works
- Date Input: Users enter their date of birth in the provided input field.
- Calculation: On clicking the "Calculate" button, the JavaScript function computes the age by comparing the current date with the input date.
- Display Results: The calculated age in years, months, and days is displayed on the screen.
